Each step retrieves the the reference data it needs from CRDS at run time by matching certain keywords in the observation to keywords in the eference files.

    "\n",
    "  The first stage, called `calwebb_detecotr1`, is applied nearly universally for all instruments and modes. It consists of detector-level corrections that are performed on a group-by-group basis, followed by ramp fitting. The output of stage 1 processing is a countrate image per exposure, or per integration for some modes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stage 2: Instrument-mode calibrations for individual exposures\n",
    "\n",
    "  The second stage is split into separate modules for imaging and spectroscopic data, called `calwebb_image2` and `calwebb_spec2` respectively. It consists of additional instrument-level and observing-mode corrections and calibrations to produce fully calibrated exposures. The details differ for imaging and spectroscopic exposures, and there are some corrections that are unique to certain instruments or modes.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- Stage 3: Combining data from multiple exposures within an observation\n",
    "\n",
    "  The third stage is divided into five separate modules depending on the observing mode. It consists of routines that work with multiple exposures and in most cases produce some kind of combined product. There are unique pipeline modules for stage 3 processing of imaging, spectroscopic, coronagraphic, AMI, and TSO observations."
